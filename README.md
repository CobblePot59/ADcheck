# ADcheck
Assess the security of your Active Directory with few or all privileges. This tool offers functionalities similar to [PingCastle](https://github.com/vletoux/pingcastle), [ORADAD](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ORADAD), or even [PurpleKnight](https://www.semperis.com/fr/purple-knight/) (with some bonuses).

ADcheck is developed in pure Python to bypass operating system constraints.

Although textual, a simple color scheme is used to navigate through the returned information (ðŸ”´ red for really bad, ðŸŸ¢ green for okay, âšª white for purely informative). A sample report is available [here](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CobblePot59/ADcheck/main/.github/report.html).

## Usage

> [!WARNING]  
> Currently, this tool is more geared towards penetration testers than auditors. If you intend to use it on Windows, it's necessary to exclude the project from the antivirus or Endpoint Detection and Response solution, as it utilizes Impacket, which is detected by these systems.
